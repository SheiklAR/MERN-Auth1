This is a single-page application on the frontend using React, Redux, 
React Router and React Bootstrap. 
The backend will use Express, MongoDB and Mongoose for the database and will 
implement authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and HTTP-only cookies. 
I used Redux for state management and Redux Toolkit for making things easier.

This app uses the [Vite] Build tool. 

The main focus of this project is to get authentication setup. 

It gives you a good understanding of creating routes/controllers in the api and 
then managing state in React/Redux."# MERN-Auth1"
